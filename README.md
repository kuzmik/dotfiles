# Dotfiles

Just my dotfiles, as well as some sublime3 packages that vanished into the ether (anything Boxy related, apparently) and my iTerm2 config.

## Install the `brew` items

Just run `brew bundle` and it will install all of the base utilities I need.

## Bombadil

Using a stupidly named dotfiles manager named [toml-bombadil](https://oknozor.github.io/toml-bombadil/). Yeah, I know, but it's the best of the lot. See the config in bombadil.toml for how to configure the dotfiles.

## oh-my-zsh [deprecated]

Setup omz. Copy the kuzmik.zsh-theme file to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes` and run `omz theme use kuzmik` if you want to use it. It's fine.

Not using this anymore, and in it's place I am just using the plugins I want, in the zsh dir.
