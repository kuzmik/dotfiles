# Dotfiles

Just my dotfiles, as well as some sublime3 packages that vanished into the ether (anything Boxy related, apparently) and my iTerm2 config.

## Install the `brew` items

Just run `brew bundle` and it will install all of the base utilities I need.

## Setup

This repo now uses [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) to manage the dotfiles, rather than toml bombadil.
