# Irssi setup

So, I don't even really use irc anymore, but sometimes I'll need to pop in somewhere and talk to someone, so I figured I'd save my old configs in the dotfiles.

Also holy eff, I haven't written perl in decades and it is such a nightmare now.

## Scripts

Yeah I have some _real_ stupid scripts here, from way back in the extremely (like literally 2000 and 2001) early 00s. Some of them I (and my network friends) wrote, some of them I cribbed from elsewhere. Don't use them, they are exceptionally stupid.

## Logs

Logs are being ignored because I don't want to upload 6gb of logfiles to my gitrepo.
