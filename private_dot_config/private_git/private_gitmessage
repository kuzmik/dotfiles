# Guidelines:
#   1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
#   3. Capitalize the subject line
#   4. Do not end the subject line with a period
#   5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
#   7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

# refactor – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# revert – reverts a previous commit # 
# style – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
